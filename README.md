# PluckToStruct

PluckToStruct is an include-able concern for your Rails models that allows you to hydrate lightweight Structs in place of ActiveRecord's heavyweight models. It's ideal for use in scenarios where performance is crucial. It can also provide you a path toward relegating ActiveRecord to database-only use, where your custom Structs take the place of typical Rails model instances in views, etc.
